# `boabro`

This repo (local copy of `https://github.com/twardoch/boabro/`) contains a `docs` folder that contains various approaches to use Python in the browser with some HTML UI solutions. 

Each page is supposed to be a small tool runnable in a browser. The tool is supposed to let the user upload a font file and the print some info about it. For this, it uses the `fonttools` Python library that runs in the browser using one of the approaches (mostly PyScript or Pyodide). 

During development/testing, you may use `https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/refs/heads/main/ofl/abrilfatface/AbrilFatface-Regular.ttf` as a remote test font file, or `testfont.ttf` in the `docs` folder.

In addition, this repo contains a skeleton Python package `boabro`, which isn't really used, but if we need to, we may add some Python code there.

Overall, this repo should be aimed at people who know Python, and would like to expand into the browser world. We want to provide them tips. 

## Running Examples

- The files in `docs` must run locally without a server. 
- You may develop a Python tool plus `playwright` to test, as part of this repo. 
- Examples that already are correct have a `_` prefix (e.g., `_gradio.html`)

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use `_puepy-bulma.html` or `_puepy-uikit.html` (from `docs`) for reference on how PyScript and the Python code should be integrated into the HTML. 
- In each unprefixed file, there's already some draft code that uses a particular UI framework/approach. Ensure that the code is working correctly with each paradigm. 
- Properly reference JS frameworks via CDN when used (Vue, React, etc.)
- Comment code for clarity, especially framework interactions
