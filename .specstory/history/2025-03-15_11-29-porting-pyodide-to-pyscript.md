FIXME: Port @pyodide-fs.htmlto PyScript, for the approach consult   @pyscript-puepy-bootstrap.html

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you port the `pyodide-fs.html` file to use PyScript with the `puepy` library, following the approach in the `pyscript-puepy-bootstrap.html` file. Let me analyze both files to understand what needs to be done.

Looking at both files, I can see that:
1. The `pyodide-fs.html` uses direct Pyodide integration for font analysis with file system capabilities
2. The `pyscript-puepy-bootstrap.html` uses PyScript with the `puepy` library for UI components

Let me create a new version that combines these approaches.
