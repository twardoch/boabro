# Implementing TODOs and Reporting Progress (2025-03-15 12:04:51)

_**User**_

Implement unchecked @TODO.md one by one, report progress into @PROGRESS.md  

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you implement the unchecked items in the TODO.md file one by one and update the PROGRESS.md file accordingly. Let's start by examining the TODO.md file to identify the unchecked items.

Looking at the TODO.md file, I can see several items that are still unchecked. Let's start with the first one: http://127.0.0.1:8080/pyodide-fs.html.

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "pyodide-fs.html" • **1** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `undefined` |

</details>

---

Let's examine the content of this file to understand what needs to be fixed:

---

Read file: /Users/adam/Developer/vcs/github.twardoch/pub/boabro/docs/pyodide-fs.html

---

Let's read the rest of the file:

---

Read file: /Users/adam/Developer/vcs/github.twardoch/pub/boabro/docs/pyodide-fs.html

---

Let's read the final part of the file:

---

Now, let's look at the TODO.md file to understand what needs to be fixed for this file:

---

Read file: /Users/adam/Developer/vcs/github.twardoch/pub/boabro/TODO.md

---

Let's look at the pyscript-puepy-bootstrap.html file to understand the approach we need to follow:

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "pyscript-puepy-bootstrap.html" • **1** results</summary>

Let's read more of the pyscript-puepy-bootstrap.html file:

---

Let's continue reading the file to understand the PyScript implementation:

Let's continue reading to find the PyScript implementation:

Now that I understand the approach, let's implement the fix for pyodide-fs.html by porting it to PyScript. I'll create a new version of the file:

Let me try again with the edit_file tool:

Let me try with the correct parameters:
