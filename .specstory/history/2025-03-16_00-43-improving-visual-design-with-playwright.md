# Improving Visual Design with Playwright (2025-03-16 01:43:58)

_**User**_

The visual design of http://localhost:8080/pyscript-puepy-frankenui.html is not very impressive. Use the playwright tool to analyze the visual side, then improve the styling by editing @pyscript-puepy-frankenui.html â€” do not add features, just make the design clearer and a better layout

_**Assistant**_

I'll analyze the visual design of the page and improve the styling. Let's start by examining the current state with Playwright.

Let me try using the run_terminal_cmd tool to check if the server is running:

---

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8080/docs/pyscript-puepy-frankenui.html
```

```
adam@Hamlet boabro % curl -I http://localhost:8080/docs/pyscript-puepy-frankenu
i.html                curl -I http://localhost:8080/docs/pyscript-puepy-franken
ui.html
HTTP/1.0 200 OK

adam@Hamlet boabro %
```

Now I'll read the file to understand its structure better:

Read file: docs/pyscript-puepy-frankenui.html

Let me read the rest of the file:
