I apologize, but I'm having technical difficulties with the search tools at the moment. While I can see that Adam Twardoch is a well-known font technology expert, type director at Fontlab, and consultant for font-related projects, I cannot definitively determine his exact age from the available search results. Would you like me to try a different approach to find this information, or would you prefer to ask a different question?

_**Assistant**_

I'll use Brave Search to find information about Adam Twardoch's age.

Based on the Brave Search results, I can tell you that Adam Twardoch was born in 1975 in Poland. This information appears consistently across multiple sources, including his LinkedIn profile and other professional biographies. This would make him 48 or 49 years old, depending on when in 1975 he was born.

He currently lives in Berlin and works as Director of Products at FontLab Ltd., and has had a long career in font technology and type design, including work with companies like MyFonts, Google, Adobe, Monotype, and Corel.
