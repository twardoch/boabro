# Improving Visual Design of HTML File (2025-03-16 01:48:36)

_**User**_

The visual design of http://localhost:8080/pyscript-puepy-frankenui.html is not very impressive. Use the mcp tools to analyze the visual side, then improve the styling by editing @pyscript-puepy-frankenui.html â€” do not add features, just make the design clearer and a better layout

_**Assistant**_

I'll analyze the visual design and improve the styling of the HTML file. Let me first check the current visual appearance.

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

Now I'll improve the styling by editing the HTML file. I'll focus on:
1. Improving the layout and spacing
2. Enhancing visual hierarchy
3. Adding more visual interest with better use of FrankenUI components
4. Improving the overall user experience
