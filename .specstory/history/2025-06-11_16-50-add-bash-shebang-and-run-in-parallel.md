# Add bash shebang and run in parallel (2025-06-11 18:50:53)

Add a bash shebang and make sure that `claudestd` are executed in parallel (using fd)

I'll add the bash shebang and convert the sequential loop to use `fd` for parallel execution.

---

```diff
- ls -1 doc | while read p; do claudestd "The 'doc/${p}/' folder contains documentation of the '${p}' framework. The 'samp/${p}/${p}-example-fl8.html' file has example usage about FontLab 8. The .jpg images in 'img/' show the new macOS Tahoe UI. I want you to clone the 'samp/${p}/${p}-example-fl8.html' page into 'samp/${p}/${p}-example-fl9.html' and in there, adapt the design as much as possible to fit the new macOS Tahoe UI, but keep using ${p}. Use the 'playwright_' tools to debug the design, make screenshots into 'samp/${p}', look at them, and iteratively improve the design."; done
+ #!/usr/bin/env bash
+ 
+ fd -t d -d 1 . doc -x claudestd "The 'doc/{/}/' folder contains documentation of the '{/}' framework. The 'samp/{/}/{/}-example-fl8.html' file has example usage about FontLab 8. The .jpg images in 'img/' show the new macOS Tahoe UI. I want you to clone the 'samp/{/}/{/}-example-fl8.html' page into 'samp/{/}/{/}-example-fl9.html' and in there, adapt the design as much as possible to fit the new macOS Tahoe UI, but keep using {/}. Use the 'playwright_' tools to debug the design, make screenshots into 'samp/{/}', look at them, and iteratively improve the design."
  
```

Perfect! I've made the following changes to the script:

1. **Added bash shebang**: `#!/usr/bin/env bash` at the top of the file to fix the linter error
2. **Converted to parallel execution**: Replaced the sequential `ls -1 doc | while read p; do ... done` loop with `fd -t d -d 1 . doc -x claudestd ...`

The new `fd` command works as follows:
- `-t d`: Find only directories
- `-d 1`: Search at depth 1 (immediate subdirectories only)
- `. doc`: Search in the `doc` directory
- `-x`: Execute the command for each found directory
- `{/}`: fd's placeholder for the basename of each found directory (equivalent to the old `${p}` variable)

This will now execute all `claudestd` commands in parallel instead of sequentially, which should significantly improve performance when processing multiple frameworks.

Rewrite it so that it accepts from CLI: 

- $1 is the name of the 'framework' 
- $2 is the filename of the prompt which contains some kind of standard placeholder for the framework name

That is, each execution just runs it once

I'll rewrite the script to accept CLI arguments and use a prompt template file.

```diff
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  
- fd -t d -d 1 . doc -x claudestd "The 'doc/{/}/' folder contains documentation of the '{/}' framework. The 'samp/{/}/{/}-example-fl8.html' file has example usage about FontLab 8. The .jpg images in 'img/' show the new macOS Tahoe UI. I want you to clone the 'samp/{/}/{/}-example-fl8.html' page into 'samp/{/}/{/}-example-fl9.html' and in there, adapt the design as much as possible to fit the new macOS Tahoe UI, but keep using {/}. Use the 'playwright_' tools to debug the design, make screenshots into 'samp/{/}', look at them, and iteratively improve the design."
+ # Check if required arguments are provided
+ if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
+     echo "Usage: $0 <framework_name> <prompt_template_file>"
+     echo "  framework_name: Name of the framework to process"
+     echo "  prompt_template_file: File containing prompt template with framework placeholders"
+     exit 1
+ fi
+ 
+ framework="$1"
+ prompt_file="$2"
+ 
+ # Check if prompt file exists
+ if [ ! -f "$prompt_file" ]; then
+     echo "Error: Prompt file '$prompt_file' not found"
+     exit 1
+ fi
+ 
+ # Read prompt template and replace placeholders with framework name
+ prompt=$(sed "s/{FRAMEWORK}/$framework/g" "$prompt_file")
+ 
+ # Execute claudestd with the customized prompt
+ claudestd "$prompt"
  
```

Perfect! I've rewritten the script with the following changes:

## New functionality:
1. **CLI Arguments**: 
   - `$1`: Framework name (e.g., "bootstrap", "tailwind", etc.)
   - `$2`: Path to prompt template file

2. **Input validation**: 
   - Checks that exactly 2 arguments are provided
   - Verifies the prompt template file exists
   - Shows usage information if arguments are missing

3. **Template processing**: 
   - Reads the prompt template file
   - Replaces `{FRAMEWORK}` placeholders with the actual framework name using `sed`

4. **Single execution**: 
   - Runs `claudestd` once with the customized prompt

## Usage example:
```bash
./act.sh bootstrap prompt_template.txt
```

## Expected prompt template file format:
The prompt file should contain `{FRAMEWORK}` placeholders that will be replaced with the framework name. For example:

```
The 'doc/{FRAMEWORK}/' folder contains documentation of the '{FRAMEWORK}' framework. The 'samp/{FRAMEWORK}/{FRAMEWORK}-example-fl8.html' file has example usage about FontLab 8. The .jpg images in 'img/' show the new macOS Tahoe UI. I want you to clone the 'samp/{FRAMEWORK}/{FRAMEWORK}-example-fl8.html' page into 'samp/{FRAMEWORK}/{FRAMEWORK}-example-fl9.html' and in there, adapt the design as much as possible to fit the new macOS Tahoe UI, but keep using {FRAMEWORK}. Use the 'playwright_' tools to debug the design, make screenshots into 'samp/{FRAMEWORK}', look at them, and iteratively improve the design.
```

This approach is much more flexible and reusable compared to the previous hard-coded loop.
